            <h3>CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> certification: the highest standard</h3>
            <p>Today more than ever, CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> professionals are an essential
            resource. From budgeting, to planning for retirement, to saving for
            education, to managing your taxes and your insurance coverage;
            &ldquo;finances&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean just one thing for most
            Americans &mdash; and &ldquo;financial planning&rdquo; means much more
            than just investing. Bringing all the pieces of your financial life
            together is a challenging task.</p>
            <p>Although many professionals may call themselves &ldquo;financial
            planners,&rdquo; CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> professionals have completed extensive
            training and experience requirements and are held to rigorous ethical
            standards. They understand all the complexities of the changing
            financial climate and are required to make financial planning
            recommendations in your best interest.<br />
            <br />
            </p>
            <h3>Why certification matters</h3>
            <p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Most people think all financial
              planners are "certified," but this isn't true -- nor are all
              certifications the same.</span></p>
            <p>Anyone may call him or herself a "financial planner," but only those
            who have fulfilled the certification and renewal requirements of the CFP
            Board can display the CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;certification marks, which represent a
            high level of competency,&nbsp;<a
                     href="http://letsmakeaplan.org/choose-a-cfp-professional/ethics-putting-your-needs-first">ethics</a>,&nbsp;and
                   professionalism. CFP Board's&nbsp;<em>Standards of Professional
                     Conduct</em>&nbsp;require CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> professionals to look out
                   for your interests above their own when delivering financial
                   planning advice.</p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>Unlike many financial advisors, CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> professionals are required to
            develop their theoretical and practical knowledge by completing a
            comprehensive course of study at a college or university with a curriculum
            approved by the&nbsp;<a
                     href="http://www.cfp.net/about-cfp-board/cfp-certification-the-standard-of-excellence">CFP
                     Board</a>. Planning professionals with training outside of the
                   CFP Board&rsquo;s approved list may meet the education
                   requirement through a review process, which looks at transcripts,
                   previous course work, and other professional designations. </p>
            <h3>Examination</h3>
            <p>CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> professionals must pass the comprehensive
            CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Certification Exam, which tests their ability to apply
            financial planning knowledge to real-life situations. The exam covers the
            financial planning process, tax planning, employee benefits and retirement
            planning, estate planning, investment management and insurance. The
            average pass rate for this difficult exam is only 55 percent to 60
            percent. This comprehensive exam ensures that CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> professionals are
            highly qualified to develop a plan for your finances.</p>
            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> professionals must have a minimum of three years&rsquo;
            experience in the financial planning process prior to earning the right to
            use the CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;certification marks. This hands-on experience
            guarantees that CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> professionals have practical financial planning
            knowledge, so you can count on them to help you create a realistic
            financial plan that fits your individual needs.</p>
            <h3>Ethics</h3>
            <p>When it comes to financial planning, CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> professionals are held to
            the highest of standards. <a
                     href="http://www.cfp.net/for-cfp-professionals/professional-standards-enforcement/standards-of-professional-conduct/code-of-ethics-professional-responsibility">CFP
                     Board's&nbsp;<em>Code of
                       Ethics</em></a><em></em><em></em>&nbsp;outlines CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>
                   professionals&rsquo; obligations to uphold principles of
                   integrity, objectivity, competence, fairness, confidentiality,
                   professionalism and diligence. The<a
                     href="http://www.cfp.net/for-cfp-professionals/professional-standards-enforcement/standards-of-professional-conduct/rules-of-conduct">&nbsp;<em>Rules
                       of Conduct</em></a><em></em>&nbsp;require CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>
                   professionals to put clients&rsquo; interests above their own,
                   and to provide their financial planning services as a "fiduciary"
                   &mdash; acting in the best interest of their financial planning
                   clients. CFP<sup>&reg;</sup> professionals are subject to sanctions if they
                   violate these standards.</p>
            <h3>Enforcement</h3>
            <p>CFP Board's rigorous enforcement of its&nbsp;<em>Standards of
              Professional Conduct</em>&nbsp;&mdash; including releasing disciplinary
            information to the public &mdash; distinguishes the
            CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;certification from the many other designations in the
            financial services industry. Anyone who seeks CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;certification
            is subject to a background check, and those whose past conduct falls short
            of CFP Board's ethical and practice standards can be barred from becoming
            certified. After attaining certification, a CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;professional who
            violates CFP Board's ethical and practice standards becomes subject to
            disciplinary action, which could include the permanent revocation of
            certification. Through diligent enforcement of its ethicaland practice
            standards, CFP Board provides you with the confidence that your
            CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;professional is both competent and ethical.</p>
